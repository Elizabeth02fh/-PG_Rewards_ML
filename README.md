## PROBLEM ##
Citizen insecurity: main problem in Latin America.
29.5% were victims of some criminal act.
Only 25% are reported.
Consequence: It hampers economic growth.
Initiative: Rewards Program.
Purpose: offer money in exchange for information.

## OBJECTIVES ##
Develop facial recognition software that is capable of recognizing required people at the Apurimac department level.
Design software that is capable of processing images of different sizes.
Implement software that is capable of processing images in search of required people.
Implement software that is capable of processing video (webcam) in real time.

## METHODOLOGY ##
The dataset of the images and the csv generated from these images can be foundtra

For the treatment of the images, OpenCV was used using 67% of training data and 33% of test,
The variables to be predicted were images of my face, of two groupmates, and finally the noise.
We use three Classification algorithms and a Neural Network.
